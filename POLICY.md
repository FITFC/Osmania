1. Osmanian History begins with the founding of Osmania I in November of 2022 by Grand Sultan Gollum0490. Osmania was built directly on the Northern highway on PurityVanilla at coordinates 0/64/-12911. Osmania was built only 12000 blocks away from spawn so that Sultan Gollum0490 could help newfriends escape spawn  by providing a rest stop with supplies to help obtain gear and food, and or a long-term base. Osmania I was destroyed by a player from the IP faction Kuqor on 4 July, 2023. Osmania has had 6 different bases in the past two years, many at the same coordinates on the North-south highway. A side effect of basing so close to spawn is frequent griefs fro IP, SD and random players. However, it is a cost worth paying to help newfriends. Osmania is on its 6th base, and this one is becoming the best iteration of osmania with the most active players.
-----------------------------------------------
1.1 Osmania doesn't have a well established Political Model, however, Osmania can be called a Semi-Democratic Monarchy. With Grand Sultan Gollum0490 as the reigning monarch.
-----------------------------------------------
1.2 Sultan Gollum0490 has found that Taxation is a tough thing to enforce in minecraft, however he does request building materials

2 Osmanian Struggles, most to least important.
    1: Griefing
     2: lack of building materials
      3: food
-----------------------------------------------
3 Osmanias economic model is as follows: what's mine is yours, what's yours is mine. Materials are distributed to Osmanian Citizens based on need, in effect, Osmania is Semi-socialistic. The labor of one player is shared amongst all players. Osmania may be involved in the Raw Gold bartering system in the future.

4 Osmania can best protect itself by only handing out coordinates to trustworthy people
